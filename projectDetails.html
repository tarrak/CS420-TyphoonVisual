      <h1>Project Premises</h1>
        <p class="description-font">
        Our customer, Dr. William Cupp, has given us tabulated typhoon data in a texual format, that he would like us to represent in a
        graphical format. There were three goals to try and reach with this project. <br><br>

        The primary goal was to write a program that uses the provided data to display in either a textual or graphical format the number
        of tropical cyclones which passed through each 0.5°x0.5° region of the ocean bounded by 160°W-180°W and 00°S-20°S during the years
        for which data is available.<br><br>

        The secondary goal was to develop a program that uses the provided data to produce a graphical display of each storm track annotated
        with entry and exit dates and storm identity for each of tropical cyclones which passed through the region of the ocean bounded by
        160°W-180°W and 00°S-20°S during the years for which data is available.<br><br>

        The tertiary goal was to create a software application which accepts tabulated data (in a format which may be prescribed) concerning
        historical tropical cyclone activity and produces various forms of output displays – such as those described – in an area of
        interest in the world.<br><br>

              <p class="description-font">
              The Software Project Management Plan is a software development plan geared towards the client that outlines the beginnings of this
              project. It establishes the roles of each team members, the estimated development plan and due dates, the purpose and scope of the
              project, and more information for the client.

            <h3>Cost and Size Analysis</h3>
              <p class="description-font">
              The Cost and Size Analysis document focuses on (obviously) estimating the size and cost of the project. The size of the
              project will be estimated using Function Points, and the corresponding result will be used along with the average lines of
              code per function point to calculate the estimated thousand lines of code generated. This estimation will be used in
              conjunction with the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) to estimate the cost of the project.
